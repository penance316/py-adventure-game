A completely professional game...

Just a quick demo text based adventure game to play around with python today.

Some improvements i'd like to make to the code and the game itself:
* create a dictionary of words to swap between when playing as an under 18 vs over 18.
* extract the game text to seperate file to avoide cluttering the logic.
* make the story longer
* create ascii game UI

# Run 
`pythom3 main.py`
